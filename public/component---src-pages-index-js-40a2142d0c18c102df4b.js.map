I’m a junior at{' '}\n      <Link href='http://www.stjohnshigh.org' target='_blank'>\n        Saint John’s High School\n      </Link>{' '}\n      in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. I am interested in studying the human\n      condition using a quantitative approach. Right now, my interests lie in\n      using public domain data to understand mental illnesses and substance\n      abuse disorders. I am also interested in understanding historical texts\n      using a computational approach (a new field!). I conduct self-directed\n      research projects and my work has been published in various IEEE\n      Conferences and in Drug and Alcohol Dependence. I've also presented my\n      work at Intel ISEF and the national JSHS.\n    </P>\n    <P>\n      I am the 2019-2020 Photographer in Residence for the Town of Westborough.\n      I document Westborough's history as it happens through photography.\n      Specifically, I try to portray daily life through the eyes of young\n      children. You can read my vision statement for this project{' '}\n      <Link target='_blank' href={require('../assets/Vision.pdf')}>\n        here\n      </Link>\n      .

At the\n      end of my term, I will compile all of my photographs from the past year\n      into a book, so that future citizens of Westborough and historians alike\n      can take a look at what Westborough was like in the interesting time in\n      which we live.\n    </P>\n    <P>\n      Apart from my scientific research and my photography, I am a writer for\n      the Community Advocate and the president of my school's mock trial team.\n    </P>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
